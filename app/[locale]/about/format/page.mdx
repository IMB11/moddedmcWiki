# Documentation format

The wiki uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files as its documentation format. In additon, [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
(GFM) is also available using [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). 

If you're not yet familiar with MDX, don't worry - it is an extension of the simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
format with added JSX capabilities, meaning you can include fancy custom components in your documentation,
such as crafting recipes.

These features are purely optional, and you can always stick to using standard Markdown in your documentation. However,
the file extension must remain `.mdx`.

#### Limitations

Because MDX can potentially allow unwanted code injection on the server, we sanitize all sources before they're rendered,
which can result in certain features of MDX being unavailable. That said, if there's a safe feature you'd like to use in
your documentation that isn't available on the wiki, please open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sinytra/Wiki/issues).

## Custom components

The wiki adds a selection of useful components that you can use in your documentation.

Import statements are not required for built-in wiki components.

### Crafting recipes

- `slots` - Exactly 9 resource location strings (asset names), in order from top-left to bottom-right.
- `result` - Resource location of the resulting item asset
- `count` - Optionally, specify the output item amount

※ Images shown in crafting recipes are sourced from documentation assets as described [here](./devs#assets).

```jsx 
<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'flint',
        'minecraft:flint', // Hint: the namespace is optional for 'minecraft' items
        'flint',
        '',
        'iron_block',
        '',
        '',
        'diamond',
        ''
    ]}
    result="furnace"
    count={4} // Optional
/>
```

Results in:

<CraftingRecipe
    slots={[
        'flint',
        'minecraft:flint',
        'flint',
        '',
        'iron_block',
        '',
        '',
        'diamond',
        ''
    ]}
    result="furnace"
    count={4}
/>

## Next steps

Once your documentation folder is set up, and you're satisfied with the looks and content of your documentation,
it is time to get it published on the wiki.
