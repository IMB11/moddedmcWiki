# Developers

Get started hosting your mod's documentation on our wiki!

This guide provides information on local development and the documentation format.
For a guide on publishing docs onto our website, please see the [Publishing](./publishing) page instead.

## Prerequisites

In order to start hosting documentation on our wiki, your mod only needs to meet a few minimal requirements: 

- Be hosted on a <GitHubIcon className="inline-block mx-1" width={16} height={16} /> GitHub repository (both private and public repositories work!)
- Be approved on either <ModrinthIcon className="inline-block mx-1 text-[var(--modrinth-brand)]" width={16} height={16} /> Modrinth or <CurseForgeIcon className="inline-block mx-1 text-[var(--curseforge-brand)]" width={16} height={16} /> CurseForge
- Have the GitHub repository linked as the mod's source code url on the respective hosting website  
  (this is currently required to verify project ownership)

Additionally, the person registering the project to the wiki should have **Maintain** or **Admin** access to its
GitHub repository.

## Folder structure

Start by creating a new directory inside your project. This can be located at any path of your choice.  
For example, you can use `docs/(your modid here)` or simply `docs`, both are equally valid.

<Callout>
    We also support scenarios where multiple mods' documentation is hosted in a single repository, as long as they're in
    separate folders.  
    This is useful if you'd like to host documentation for multiple of your mods in a single place.
</Callout>

A minimal example folder layout may look like this:

```
docs
├── blocks
│   ├── generator.mds
│   └── _meta.json
├── introduction.mdx
├── _meta.json
└── sinytra.wiki.json
```

<details>
    <summary>Show complete example</summary>
    
    Here is a complete example including assets and translations.
    
    ```
    docs
    ├── .assets
    │   └── item
    │       └── examplemod
    │           └── generator.png
    ├── .translated
    │   └── de_de
    │       └── blocks
    │           ├── generator.mdx
    │           └── _meta.json
    ├── blocks
    │   ├── generator.mds
    │   └── _meta.json
    ├── introduction.mdx
    ├── _meta.json
    └── sinytra.wiki.json
    ```
</details>

Let's talk about what each of these files does:
- `sinytra.wiki.json`: The main metadata file, the "heart" of the documentation package, carries information about the
project. For its content format, see the complete explanation below.
- `_meta.json`: Can be placed in the root folder as well as each subfolder. Provides display names for files and folders,
which are shown in the documentation navigation sidebar on the wiki. If not provided, fallback display names are generated automatically.
- `*.mdx` files: Contain documentation contents. To learn more about the MDX format, please see their [website](https://mdxjs.com/).  
As MDX compiles to JavaScript, the Wiki imposes certain restrictions on what components and tags can be used in addition to standard Markdown.
For a complete description, please read below.

### Assets

<Callout>
    Save yourself time manually exporting all assets using our companion [**Gradle plugin**](#gradle-plugin-companion),
    which integrates with popular mod loader toolchains and can **automatically generate rendered assets** for you!
</Callout>

Assets are used to display images of items, blocks and other mod content across the website. These can be used as part
of crafting recipes, sidebar information or custom components.

Assets are identified using [resource locations](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_location) using the same syntax as
in the game itself. It's recommened to match asset names with the in-game IDs of the objects they belong to.

Rendered mod assets including **both items and blocks** should be placed under `.assets/item/(modid)` inside the
documentation directory, where `modid` is the namespace of each texture you wish to provide.

Each asset **must be in `.png` format**. The name of the file is up to your choice.

For example, `examplemod:generator` would point to `(root)/.assets/item/examplemod/generator.png`.

## Documentation format

### Wiki Metadata

```json title="sinytra-wiki.json"
{
    "id": "mffs",
    "platform": "modrinth",
    "slug": "mffs"
}
```

JSON properties explanation:

- `id`: Unique project id used across the wiki. We recommend using your mod id.
- `platform`: Your mod's distribution platform. Can be either of `modrinth` or `curseforge`.
- `slug`: The host platform's project slug.

The project slug can be easily extracted from your mod's project page URL as shown in the examples below, where `{slug}`
is a placeholder for the actual value.
- For Modrinth projects: `https://modrinth.com/mod/{slug}`  
- For CurseForge projects: `https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/{slug}`

### Folder metadata

```json title="_meta.json"
{
    "blocks": "Blocks",
    "items": "Completely custom name",
    "introduction.mdx": "Introduction"
}
```
